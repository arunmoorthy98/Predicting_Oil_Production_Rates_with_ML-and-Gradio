# Predicting_Oil_Production_Rates_with_ML-and-Gradio

# Project Overview
This project aims to predict the oil volume in barrels using various features related to oil extraction processes. We leverage historical data and machine learning techniques to build and evaluate models capable of forecasting oil production volume accurately.

# Features and Dataset
The dataset consists of multiple features such as dates, oil properties, and operational parameters from the Volve field. Key features include:

Date of extraction

Operational parameters (pressure, temperature, etc.)

Oil properties (viscosity, gravity, etc.)

# Models Used
Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

# Installation

To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:


pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn 

scikit-learn gradio

# Usage

To predict the oil volume using the trained model, follow these steps:

Load your dataset.

Run the preprocessing script to prepare your data.

Execute the model training script to train the 
model.


# Interactive Prediction

The Gradio app allows users to input feature values and see the model's predicted oil volume. It is accessible via a web interface launched by the script.
